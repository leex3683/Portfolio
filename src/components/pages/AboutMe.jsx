            <p>Puzzles have always fascinated me, and that's why I'm usually at a desk with my nose in a textbook, or on the wall at a bouldering gym. Activities like these challenge me to find solutions that aren't always intuitive or easy to find, and overcoming these obstacles is core to what I find enjoyment and fulfillment in.</p>
