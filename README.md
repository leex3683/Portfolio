## Usage

Clicking the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page will bring you to the referenced sections.  To access the applications, you can click the "MyApp" link at the bottom of each card. Note: only some of the applications have been built at this time, so those html pages linked are placeholders, only.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
